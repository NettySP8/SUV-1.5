        As per the business process, if a case is locked in the SUV, there are certain actions required by the SUV users on many cases before they are unlocked.<p></p> 
        Presently, the SUV system does not have a feature to display a consolidated list of such locked cases so the SUV user could track and act on such cases. <p>The team is using some external workaround to maintain the list of such cases. The requirement is to display a list of the locked cases on which an action is needed by the SUV users.

A new drop-down menu list to be  displayed on the 'Place penalty on lock' pop-up window with the title â€˜Reason'
